open a terminal in the root directory and run:
peerjs --port 3001


then open an other terminal and run:
npm run devStart



now you can open a browser and type:
localhost:3000

then you will see that a random IP address will be added to your localhost:3000

if you type the full url on a new tab, then the new user will be added to the conversation.

192.168.43.43/"THE EXACT RANDOM NUMBER OF YOUR CHATROOM URL TAIL"
